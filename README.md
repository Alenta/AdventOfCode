## Advent of Code
No real goal here, my first Advent of Code. </br>
Day 1 was easy, but let's see how long I can go! ** </br> 
Day 2 was harder or maybe I had trouble focusing, skipped bonus but might go back to it. * </br>
Day 3 was doable quickly enough. ** </br>
Day 4 was... Harder. * </br>
Day 5, spent half the time trying to understand the challenge prompt. ** </br>
Day 6, falling a bit behind due to time but still pushing * </br>
Day 7 went suprisingly well ** </br>
Day 8 stumped me, gave up after not really understanding the prompt </br>
Day 9
